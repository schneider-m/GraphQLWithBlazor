# Simple GraphQL client using client-side Blazor 

A simple [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) client that uses [GraphQL for .NET](https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet)
to execute GraphQL queries. The app itself is a [client-side Blazor web app](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor)
using WebAssembly.
 
 The [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) is integrated as a Razor component based on
 [Blazaco](https://github.com/Kyle-Undefined/Blazaco) and is utilized for editing and visualizing the GraphQL queries and responses.
